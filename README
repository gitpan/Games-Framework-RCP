Games-Framework-RCP

This is the (currently in development) set of modules for a
video game tactics based database driven game.  The goal
is to provide implementation independent functionality
so that this can be used anywhere, from IRC to websites or more.

Why was the acronym "RCP" chosen though?  Others that have
made a similar system like this often pretended their system
was in a computer known as a Ref Control Panel.  The name
has stuck.  Feel free to call it something else in your
own home game.

STATUS

Enough of the database tables are implemented for those
daring to try it out.  However, there is no driver program
yet, so either lots of coding is required, or one must
manipulate the database directly.

REQUIREMENTS

Make sure you have Perl 5.10, DBIx::Class, Exceptions::Class,
and Sub::Exporter.  Also, having a database installed would be
beneficial.

INSTALLATION

Either install via CPAN/CPANPLUS, or use the tried and true method:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Of course, you may need priviledges for make install.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
