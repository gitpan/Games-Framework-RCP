Games-Framework-RCP

This is the (currently in development) set of modules for a
Final Fantasy Tactics based database driven game.  The goal
is to provide implementation independent functionality
so that this can be used anywhere, from IRC to websites or more.

Very little is complete at this time.  I have only
uploaded what I felt was confident to be shown.  Either way,
feel free to scrutinize it and let me know how to improve
everything.

INSTALLATION

Due to how CPAN and CPANPLUS work, installing
this module and its dependencies do not install the database that
drives this system.  Therefore, the following instructions are given
to ensure that everything gets installed.

1)  Download the tar.gz file.
2)  Extract the tar.gz file.  In the command line,
    tar xvf Games-Framework-RCP.tar.gz> will work.
3)  Change to the extracted directory.
4)  Type in the command line: perl Makefile.PL.
5)  Load the pg.sql file from the scripts directory into your
    PostGresQL system.
6)  Set the environment variables DB_TEST_USERNAME and
    DB_TEST_PASSWORD with your preferred username and password.
7)  Type in the command line: make.
8)  Type in the command line: make test.
    If the tests do not pass, let me know.
9)  Type in the command line: sudo make install.
10) Create/use a "driver program" to interface with these modules.
11) Have fun!
